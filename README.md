This is the readme file of pdf upload project. In these project we upload the pdf and ask the questions and it searche the pdf and gives us a relevant answer.
In this project there are different files and one of the files is the main.py which is the main file which we have created in the python language.
Second file is the poetry.lock file the main function of this file is to lock the versions so we have locked the version of the python so that it can work on the older version as well so we have locked the version which is a 2.0.
3rd file is our requirements.txt file where we have used the fastapi==0.103.2, python-multipart==0.0.6, sqlalchemy==1.4.42, databases==0.8.0, scikit-learn==1.2.2, numpy==1.24.3, PyPDF2==3.0.1, nltk==3.8.1, uvicorn==0.22.0, jinja2==3.1.2, aiosqlite==0.19.0, pydantic==1.10.12, slowapi==0.1.4  
We have even used a replete file so we can have a seamless coding experience and environment and we can combine the different part of codes
One file is the .gitignore it is created when the code is uploaded on github basically it ignore all those files and directories which are not important for main code.
One of our main files are index file basically it is an html code so that it gives us a front end designing where we can see a web page where it shows us how it shows us to upload our pdf file and it helps us to ask the question and it shows the answer so it all are possible because of our html file.
So we have integrated all these files, first we have created our html files so it gives us a proper web page where we have integrated our main python file so that it can take the PDF file and it can do the searching for the words which we are seeking for and it gives us the relevant information all these things are combined with our API so it helps us in searching for the information.

The code in this file represents a high-level design architecture.
It incorporates several abstractions and components for handling specific functions, such as PDF text extraction, database interactions, and natural language processing (NLP) for document embeddings and similarity matching. 
This approach involves architectural choices at a more abstract level rather than specific, detailed coding methods or algorithmic optimizations.
Here are the main high-level components:
API Layer (FastAPI): Manages HTTP routes for endpoints like uploading PDFs and asking questions. This layer is abstracted from the implementation details of how requests are processed.
Database Abstraction: Utilizes SQLAlchemy to define models and manage data interactions with an SQLite database.
Document Processing Pipeline: Includes PDF text extraction, text chunking, and TF-IDF-based embedding generation, focusing on the process without low-level handling of each function's details.
Logging and Error Handling: Implements logging and structured error handling, which supports maintainability and monitoring rather than focusing on internal function-specific error resolutions.
This architecture primarily enables modularity, scalability, and reusability at a high level, rather than focusing on low-level specifics like memory management or performance optimizations at the code or function level.
